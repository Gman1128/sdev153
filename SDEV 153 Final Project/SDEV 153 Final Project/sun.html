                <h3>What is The Sun?</h3>
                <p>The Sun is a star at the very center of our solar system. It is a giant, massive sphere of plasma.
                    It is the primary source for energy for life on Earth. The gravity of the sun helps keep the solar 
                    system together, making sure that planets, asteroids, comets, or any space debris stay in their
                    respective orbits. It generaes light and heat and helps support life on our planet.

                <h3>How Was The Sun Formed?</h3>
                <p>The Sun fromed around 4.6 billion years of go, during the time before our solar sytem was even formed.
                    It started forming in a massive spinning cloud of gas and dust called a solar nebula. When the nebula 
                    started to collapse under the weight of its own gravity, it spun faster and faster and started to 
                    flatten into a disk. Most materials drifting through space started to be pulled toward the center and 
                    begun forming our Sun. Any material left started drifting together in big clump form the planets of our 
                    solar system.

                <ul>
                    <li>The Sun creates solar flares when the magnetic feilds of the Sun start colliding with each
                        other. Energy released from the solar flares are equal to millions of 100-megaton hydrogen 
                        bombs exploding.
                    </li>
                    <li>The sun will eventually lose all of its enrgy and will startd to explode> The around half way
                        to losing all of its enrgy. It won't happen for another 5 billion years
                    </li>
                    <li>The sun is not habitable due to the extreme hot temperatures it produces. Getting close to it will 
                        burn any object.
                    </li>   
                    <li>Earth wasn't alwasys ruled by humans. Millions of years ago, dinosuars walked the planet. These were
                        giant beasts that were as tall as trees and were known to destroy other dinosuars, some being bigger 
                        than them.
