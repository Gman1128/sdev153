                <h3>What is The Moon?</h3>
                <p>The moon is a large and round object that orbits our planet Earth and helps reflect the light off the sun.
                    It is a barren planetoid with no life where the temperature is always cold. It is essential for Earth and us 
                    because the gravational pull from it helps stablize Earth's axil tilt, which stabilixes the climates cycles 
                    across the globe. It is also needed to create tides for us becuase they have played a significant role for the 
                    development of life for our plaent by providing a predictible rhythm for our coastal ecosystems. Without the moon,
                    the climate would be more extreme and life wouldn't exist.

                <h3>How Was The Moon Formed?</h3>
                <p>The moon was fromed around 4.5 billion years of go, shortly after the Earth was formed. It started
                    forming when an large celestial body, which is often referred to as "Theia", roughly around the size 
                    of the planet Mars collided with the Earth when it was still young. During the collison between the two
                    objects, debris flew out into orbit. The debris would eventually clump together due to gravity over a period
                    of time. The Moon was eventually created and now orbits around Earth.

                <ul>
                    <li>Every years, while the Moon orbits around Earth, ot is slowey moving away from Earth
                        by about 3.8 centimeters
                    </li>
                    <li>Humanity first visited and landed on the moon on July 20th, 1969
                    </li>
                    <li>During the day, the Moon's surface can reach to temperatures around 120 degrees celsius, and 
                        during the night it reaches to temperatures arounf -130 degrees celsius
                    </li>   
                    <li>On the moon, gravity is much weaker than on Earth. You will weigh about one-sixth of your weight
