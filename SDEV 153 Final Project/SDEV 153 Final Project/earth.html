                <h3>What is Earth?</h3>
                <p>Earth is the third closest planet located to the sun and is the only planet that 
                    is able to host life. It is mostly covered by 71% water, with the other 29% being 
                    the Earth's crust, whcih is covered in mouantains, valleys, and ridges. These 
                    formations are formed by tectonic plates, which are alwasys slowly moving. Earth 
                    helps fill the atmosphere oxygen, one of the key factors to support life, through 
                    the photosynthesis of planets that are all over the planet. Earth is the planet we 
                    are born and live on.

                <h3>How Was Earth Formed?</h3>
                <p>Earth was fromed around 4.54 billion years of go, during the time our solar syatem was forming.
                    At first, there was only the sun and big clouds of floating gas and dust driftimg through Space
                    with no purpose. But overtime, gravity started to come into effect and started pulling the dust
                    and gas together to form clumps. Throught the years, these clumps would become bigger and bigger 
                    and started to collide with each other to form largers pieces. Throughout time, these peices would 
                    continue to collide and stick together to eventually form a giant space rock called Earth.

                <h3>Fun Earth Facts!</h3>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>While most people thing Earth is perfectly round, it is not accurate. At the North and South poles,
                        Earth is a little bit flattened, making the planet a oblated sphere
                    </li>
                    <li>While the continents on Earth today are spread out across the planet, it wasn't always like this. 
                        Millions of years ago, the continents were all part of one single giant landmass which was called 
                        Pangea
                    </li>
                    <li>While on Earth everywhere appears to be green, it appears to be mostly blue when you are viewing it 
                        from space. This gave Earth the title as the "Blue Planet"
                    </li>   
                    <li>Earth wasn't alwasys ruled by humans. Millions of years ago, dinosuars walked the planet. These were
                        giant beasts that were as tall as trees and were known to destroy other dinosuars, some being bigger 
                        than them.
                    </li>
                </ul>
